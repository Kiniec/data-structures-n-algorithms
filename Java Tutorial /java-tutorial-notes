public class java_tutorial.Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
                code goes here
}
Procedural programming: the program contains the main() method, and other
        user defined method/s nested inside the calls

 public class java_tutorial.Test {
        public static void main (String[] args){
            code
                    }
         public static void test()  {

         }
   *classes can have the same name

 Object-oriented Programming
    the program contains more than one classes,
    only contains the main() method

if statement will always have logical expression -  condition

for loop:
    assign a variable named i; logical operation; increment;
       for(int i = 0; i<30; i++) {
        System.out.print(i + " ")
       }
data types
    Primitive - int, double, char, boolean
    Reference - arrays, Strings, objects
        not created by java
        defined by the programmer
Object-Oriented Programming - OOP
    create your own classes and use them to define/create object
    Objects are are created from classes
        classes are blueprints from which you create objects
    an object is an instance of its class
    class encapsulate both variables and methods
    class methods are called instance methods
        ***will not have the keyword static
    object will contain both variables and methods
    EX:
        car, circle, person, array, bank account
When creating a class -
    define name
    must start with uppercase letter
    must define variables (data structures)
    must define instance methods (algorithm )
    Variables and methods will be copied to any other object created from the class.
        methods will know variables and will be able to manipulate them

classes are used as a data type to define an objects(variables)
 called "user defined data types "
 abstract data type
    can include any variable of any type inside the class.

 classes have special methods called "constructors"
    used with the "new" operator to create objects from the class
    are methods that don't have a type
        neither void or returning methods
        can be overloaded
            can have multiple constructors in the same class
    used to create objects and set value for its variables during the creation process.
    can only be called one time (with creating the object).
    should have the same name as class

   Define class variables: those variables that will be copied inside each object:
            Access_modifier data_type variable_name
                private       double       radius;
    Access modifiers are usually private to not allow the user to access them from outside the class.

    Define instance methods: Those methods that will be copied to each object:
            Access_modifier                  type                method_name(){
                public          void or value returning            xxxx
            }//end of method

            public void setColor()
             {
             }//end of instance method setColor()

    Instance methods
        can be void or value returning methods
        will not have the key word static
        can be called by:
            their name() if they are call by another instance method in the same clas  object of the class
            Object_Name.method_name() if they are called by an object of the class.

user of the class can only access the public components of the class
    will only be able to access the private variables through the public methods

Class Design
    must have public methods to
     access
     manipulate (set new values, display the value, get the value and any other processing )
    the class variables
    EX:
        method that is used to set a new color                      should be named  setColor()
        method that is used to get the value or the Circle's color "            "   get color()
        method that is used to display the contents of an array    "             " display()
            inside an object
        method that is used to insert an element in an array inside "            " insert()
            an object
        method that is used to insert an amount in a bank account  "             "  deposit()
            inside an object
            \
Class_Name object_name = new Constructor();
    constructor can only be called one time
    if used to create the object
        the values of the variables can only be changed if have method to manipulate the variable

Variables defined inside a class are diff from those defined in
    a method
    another block of code

 variables  defined in a method should be initialized  before they are used
    should assign them values before using them.

 variables defined inside a class will be copied inside the object when you create an object
    if using a constructor that does not assign values for those variables
        they will be initialized to their default values:
